Despite advancements in medicine and technology in recent decades, human populations remain highly vulnerable to the effects of epidemics, as demonstrated by the global impact of COVID-19. The broad interconnectedness of social networks complicates efforts to effectively contain the spread of highly contagious diseases. In this paper, we develop a model for simulating disease outbreaks on a network and evaluate the effectiveness of various vaccination strategies in containing outbreak size and reducing fatalities. We investigate whether a single strategy consistently outperforms others under all conditions and consider how selection of the best strategy depends on the characteristics of both the network and the disease. We also emphasise the importance of selecting the optimal vaccination strategy to mitigate social and economic impacts and explore further extensions to the model to improve its realism.
